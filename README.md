# calare


## Introduction

Calare is a Tool designed for UNSW Tutors who are looking for a way to export their teaching timetable to an ICS file

## Usage

Running the command

```
./calare
```

will lead you through an interactive sequence of steps. 

You will initially be asked to provide
	- Your Name
	- Course you are teaching
	- Offering (ie 20T3)

Then, you will infinitely be asked to add classes, and you will be prompted for: 
	- Class Code (ie H13A)
	- Tutor or Assistant Tutor? 
	- Do you want the tutorial to be added if you are an assistant tutor? 

Finally, the ICS file will be created for you to input into your Outlook or GCal :) 

Enjoy!
